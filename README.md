# Rubiks Cube Solver
 This Java based implementation contains solver for Rubik's Cube using Kociemba two phase Algorithm. Actually the codes are collected and implemented based on these resources( [Resource](https://github.com/hishamcse/Rubiks-Cube-Solver/tree/main/Rubik's%20Cube/0.Resources) ). Currently, it contains manual solver. I will update this repository when I will implement a GUI for it.
